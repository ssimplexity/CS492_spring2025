- Others:
  - The official language in the class is English. 
  - Homework assignments will be announced on the KLMS.
  - Mathematical maturity and competence in formal proof writing is a must for the class.
  - All homeworks are to be written in Latex or in other forms of editors. 
  - For the homeworks, you can discuss with a small group of students, but you are expected to write solutions yourself in your own language. Also indicate the students you discussed with, or/and the reference you consulted for the homeworks.
  - No ChatGPT. Period.  
  - A strict policy against dishonest behaviors will be applied; expect an "F" grade and be reported to the SoC board when you fail to follow the [honor code](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/content?menu=309).
